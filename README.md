Wiki Extraxtor 
Development of a data extractor in phython
Purpose 
Wikipedia Matrix is a solution for extract data dwhose goal is to extract existing table from a wikipedia’s page through the HTML or by the Wikitext.

In order to do so, the Solution  needs to verify that the page/URL is from Wikipedia. It also verify if the URL exists.
If the page contains no table, the software will inform you that the page had no valid table. For each existing table in the Wikipedia’s page, there will be one .csv files created : one from the  the HTML one
CONTEXT 
The objective of this project is to develop a version of data extraction in phython

Bibliotheques Phyton

    • BeautifulSoup
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.
    • Requests 
Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human beings.

Python’s standard urllib2 module provides most of the HTTP capabilities you need, but the API is thoroughly broken. It was built for a different time — and a different web. It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to perform the simplest of tasks.
    
    • CSV

he so-called CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is the most common import and export format for spreadsheets and databases. There is no « CSV standard », so the format is operationally defined by the many applications which read and write it. The lack of a standard means that subtle differences often exist in the data produced and consumed by different applications. These differences can make it annoying to process CSV files from multiple sources. Still, while the delimiters and quoting characters vary, the overall format is similar enough that it is possible to write a single module which can efficiently manipulate such data, hiding the details of reading and writing the data from the programmer.
